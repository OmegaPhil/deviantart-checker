General
=======

This was a 'quick' project to make a notifier script to email me (actual command is configurable) when certain interesting events happen with my
deviantART account (www.deviantart.com - currently comments, replies, unread notes and watched people's deviations posted), optionally with a whitelist
to only bug me when certain people are involved for certain event types, checking every 5 minutes by default.

I don't have a need for further functionality, but as usual if there is enough demand, I can extend it. Please star this project if you use it so
that I know which projects are most popular and therefore worth working on.

The deviantAnywhere Firefox addon (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/deviantanywhere/) was used as an example when developing the
deviantART service code. 


Requirements
============

Tested with (if you get it working on earlier versions please say, all available in Debian repos):

Python v3.4+
Beautiful Soup v4.3.2: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
lxml v3.6.4 (used as the HTML parser with Beautiful Soup): http://lxml.de/
Requests v2.3.0: http://python-requests.org
python-YAML v3.11: http://pyyaml.org/


Documentation
=============

This is a very simple script currently - it takes no arguments and runs in a loop, polling your deviantART account after a delay. To configure,
create the '~/.config/deviantart-checker' directory and copy/rename example.conf to 'deviantart-checker.conf' inside, editing it as needed (see the
comments in the file).

If you follow the sendemail example, when someone replies to a comment you made, you'll get an email like the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: [deviantart-checker] New Replies

Message:

New Replies:

On <deviation title> by <artist>:

<user> posted:
blah blah blah blah

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The output has also been tailored for other events and is similar.
