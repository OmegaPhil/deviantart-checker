BREAKING CHANGE: Configuration is now read from the ''~/.config/deviantart-scripts'

deviantart-deviations-downloader.py v0.1 (18.10.16):
Script created to allow backing up gallery structure and deviation detail.

v0.5 (21.03.15):

when it happens.

Allow for the whitelist to be selectively applied to certain events only - e.g.
filter deviations but always be notified on replies.
Improve text generation from initially HTML information associated with events.
