deviantart-deviations-downloader.py v0.2 and updated devart.py (16.02.17):
deviantART has reworked their HTMl a little meaning that all scripts failed
to log in, and then once that was fixed, deviation downloading failed completely
as the gallery widget had been completely redone. This has now been sorted, with
the exception that

*deviation folders are no longer savable*,

as the gallery widget no longer contains that information. It is available via a
separate pass to analyse the folders specially, but I don't need this currently
so it hasn't been implemented.

deviantart-checker.py v1 (18.10.16):
deviantartART interaction code has now been moved out into devart.py.
BREAKING CHANGE: Credentials are now stored in
'~/.config/deviantart-scripts/credentials.conf' for clean sharing with other
scripts in the (now) suite.
BREAKING CHANGE: Configuration is now read from the ''~/.config/deviantart-scripts'
directory - please move your configuration manually.
Note content is now fetched when reporting on unread notes (courtesy of
progression with the notes downloader script).

deviantart-notes-downloader.py v0.1 (18.10.16):
Script created to allow backing up sent and received notes.

deviantart-unread-sent-notes-checker.py v0.1 (18.10.16):
Script created to allow monitoring when sent notes become read.

deviantart-deviations-downloader.py v0.1 (18.10.16):
Script created to allow backing up gallery structure and deviation detail.

v0.5 (21.03.15):
Only allow one instance of the script to run at once.

v0.4 (11.10.14):
command_to_run_on_failure in the config now allows you to run a configurable
command when an unhandled error happens. The script continues to run under these
circumstances, but now you don't have to wrap around stderr somehow to get told
when it happens.

v0.3 (08.09.14):
Allow for the whitelist to be selectively applied to certain events only - e.g.
filter deviations but always be notified on replies.
Improve text generation from initially HTML information associated with events. 

v0.2 (30.08.14):
Initial public release.
